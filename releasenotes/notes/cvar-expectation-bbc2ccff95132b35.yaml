    CVaR Expectation Values

    Given a diagonal observable H, often corresponding to the objective function of an optimization problem, we are
    often not as interested in minimizing the average energy of our observed measurements. In this context, we are
    satisfied if at least some of our measurements achieve low energy. (Note that this is emphatically not the case
    for chemistry problems).

    To this end, one might consider using the best observed sample as a cost function during variational
    optimization. The issue here, is that this can result in a non-smooth optimization surface. For this reason,
    one might consider smoothing the optimization surface by using not just the best observed sample, but instead
    averaging over some fraction of best observed samples. This is exactly what the CVaR estimator accomplishes [1].

    Let alpha be a real number in [0,1] which specifies the fraction of best observed samples which are
    used to compute the objective function. Observe that if alpha = 1, CVaR is equivalent to a standard expectation
    value. Similarly, if alpha = 0, then CVaR corresponds to using the best observed sample. Intermediate values of
    alpha interpolate between these two objective functions.

    The functionality to use CVaR is included into the operator flow through a new subclass of OperatorStateFn
    called CVaRMeasurement. This new StateFn object is instantied in the same way as an OperatorMeasurement
    with the exception that it also accepts an `alpha` parameter and that it automatically enforces the
    `is_measurement` attribute to be True. Observe that it is unclear what a CVaRStateFn would represent were it
    not a measurement.

    Examples::

            qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
            qc.h(0)
            op = CVaRMeasurement(Z, alpha=0.5) @ CircuitStateFn(primitive=qc, coeff=1.0)
            result = op.eval()


    Similarly, an operator corresponding to a standard expectation value can be converted into a CVaR expectation
    using the CVaRExpectation converter.

    Examples::

            qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
            qc.h(0)
            op = ~StateFn(Z) @ CircuitStateFn(primitive=qc, coeff=1.0)
            cvar_expecation = CVaRExpectation(alpha=0.1).convert(op)
            result = cvar_expecation.eval()
   
    See [1] for additional details regarding this technique and it's empircal performance.
