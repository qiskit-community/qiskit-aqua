    "## Background: Motivation and Opportunities\n",
    "The representation of matrices sparsely as linear combinations of Pauli operators is critical in many quantum algorithms. As such, the Operator classes are the workhorses of Aqua today (0.6.2), containing both the expectation value and evolution logic used by most of its algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are several opportunities for improvement:\n",
    "* **Basic Construction & Rapid Protoyping:** Aqua's Operators were initially built as procedural infrastructure rather than first-class programming primitives. Improvements to syntax and interfaces can enable the succinctness and power typical of mathematical Operator language\n",
    "* **Separation of Operator Math and Operator Algorithms**\n",
    "    * Ease of understanding: The \"Operator algorithm\" logic - the ExpectationValue, Evolution, grouping, and symmetry analysis - is mostly spread across the 3000-line operator hierarchy, and is very branchy for different modes of execution\n",
    "    * Ease of extension: Modification to the expectation value, evolution, grouping, and symmetry logic is a core use case (e.g. the [CVaR expectation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04769), [linear combination evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5822), or the many recent papers on [Pauli grouping](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23879)), but not explicitly supported today\n",
    "* **Smooth Borders with Broader Qiskit**\n",
    "    * Terra's `quantum_info` module also supports operator math, but is mostly matrix-based\n",
    "    * **Remote Operator Algorithms:** Aer's fast ExpectationValue is not transparently or cleanly interchangeable with Aqua's local ExpectationValue today. The concept of an Algorithm not provided by Aqua is not yet defined to support this type of interchangeability cleanly"

    "        * MatrixOperator in the standard basis with $2^n\\times 2^n$ elements was initially built for performance improvements which are no longer relevant\n",
    "    * Only dependency on Terra is through Pauli module, but this is largely symbolic (not an inexorable component)\n",

We encourage the reader to scan lines [361-395 of Aqua 6.1 VQE’s](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/blob/stable/qiskit/aqua/algorithms/adaptive/vqe/vqe.py#L361) ExpectationValue calculation to try to understand where and how the expectation is computed.

Note that it fundamentally requires the user to understand a certain execution flow, the correct functions to use to do this, and how those functions work with their execution mode.

Further, there are no hints that a change from the Z basis for each Pauli is being performed here, or matrix multiplication if the system chooses to do that instead."
